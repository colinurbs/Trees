# Trees
Tree simulator based on genetic algorithm 

I thought it would be interesting to have a system using agenetic algorithm to generate trees but rather than testing them in a vacuum I'm testing them in the context of a forest where each member of a generation is competing with it's siblinging for a limited amount of light.

Fitness is determined by which tree's leaves capture the most 'light' while instituting a penalty for excesive limb segments.

Generates tree evaluates fitness and creates new generations but still has (many) major issues
